 Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is applicable only when we have target variable that contains binary values such as true/false, 0/1 ,yes/no and so on.Unlike,linear regression algorithm it provides the sigmoid curve of values that ranges in between 0 and 1,these values will never exceeds this range of 0-1 and hence provide the discrete sets of values.If I say the basic margin is of 0.5 or my threshold value is 0.5 than the values less than 0.5 will be predicted as 0 whereas the values greater than 0.5 will be predicted as 1 only.
